# Evaluation Project Summary

Name: Andrew Weber

Date: May 4, 2019

Candidates should answer the following questions. Additional documentation,
process, or work artifacts should be contained in this `candidate-documents`
directory.

Please consider these questions: Most of them require more than a
few words to answer, but you should not feel obliged to write a long essay.

## How long did it take you to complete this project?
Most of the Vue stuff took me about two hours.
Styling took me another three.


## How did the project go for you?
The project went very well. I was really happy to dip my toes into a better orgnaized Vue project than what
I had ever written on my own before. I was happy to see small little Vuex functions like `mapState` and `mapActions`.
I also learned a lot from this site [here](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/using-with-vuex.html) on how to utilize vue-test library.

I tend to move pretty slowly when I do front end design, specifically in this case, fading the backdrop image behind the
text but keeping the text opacity the same was a big struggle for me. Fortunately these two sites were a big help:
- https://codepen.io/ncerminara/pen/eFzJI/
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::before
From this I could intuit how to utilize the functionality of a `::before` without having the ability use it
to control the background image.


## What are you especially proud of in this project?
I was happy to see how comfortable I was working in Vue. The prompts were all straight foward, and I was really pleased
that most of that patterns were very familiar to me.


## If you could revise, refactor, or spend more time on any aspect of the project, which would it be?
I would have preferred to move `movie` into it's own component to keep `Home.vue` pretty clean.
I understand for demo purposes there isn't much else on the page, but with much else on that
page I think the markup would start to look cluttered.


## If you were making up the project for others to complete, what would you change, add, or remove?
For me, I'd have been happier with even more work with Vue components and stores, and less styling.


## Was this project fun?
Yeah! I was really happy with timeframe I completed it in. I thought I was able to demonstrate a lot of competencies
without having to spend tens of hours proving it.


## Feel free to include any other thoughts or feedback you have for us.
